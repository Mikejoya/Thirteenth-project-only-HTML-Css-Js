## Conclusions
> When the project started I had an idea in my head, that as the project progressed it changed with each progress
 because!
Some lines of code written I had to make changes due to some conflicts that they generated, in addition to doing my best not to repeat code.
From my point of view, the frontendMentor page is one of the best options to improve your coding.
I will continue.
